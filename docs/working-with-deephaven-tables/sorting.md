Sorting is a common operation in data analysis, and Deephaven makes it easy to sort data in a variety of ways. This guide will show you how to sort table data both programmatically and by using the UI.

## Sort programmatically

You can sort table data programmatically by using the `sort()` and `sort_descending` methods. This method takes a column name as an argument and returns a new table with the data sorted in ascending order.

```python
