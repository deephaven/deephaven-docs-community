This guide shows you to how to use the **Select Distinct Values** feature, which modifies a table to show unique values from a selected column. This produces the same result as the query method [`select_distinct`](../../reference/table-operations/select/select-distinct.md). A Select Distinct table is often used to trigger filters on other tables in a workspace. See [How to filter without writing queries](./filters.md) to learn more.

From the options menu of the table you'd like to reduce, choose **Select Distinct Values**. Pick a column from which to display unique values.
