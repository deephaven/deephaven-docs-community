<em>Many examples in your installation guides show the use of `docker compose`. Is it required?</em>

<p></p>

No. You can run Deephaven via Docker without [compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See [here](../../tutorials/docker-install.md#tldr) for an example. Docker compose does make customizing your deployment easier, though, so we recommend it for users who want to do that.
